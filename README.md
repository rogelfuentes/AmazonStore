# AmazonStore
In this activity, I'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills I have learned in the bootcamp. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, I will program this app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
